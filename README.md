FireworksExtensions
===================

I'm going to attempt to locate and add the source files used to my Fireworks extensions from http://www.senocular.com/fireworks/extensions/ to this repo for anyone who wants to use/update/manipulate/etc.

Some source files may be older than the posted extensions, or may be incomplete, and I'm not sure if all extension source files will be found, but I'll try to get up as much as I can.
